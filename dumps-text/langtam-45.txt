   Visual Memories Made History

Month: September 2014

Metaphors of a transcending dream…

   “I like to photograph my dreams”

   Trust in dreams, for in them is the hidden gate to eternity, said
   Kahlil Gibran. But, for Shiv Kiran, one of the Project 365
   photographers, dreams are the gateway to photographs. “My dreams
   combine verbal, visual and emotional stimuli into a non-sensical but
   entertaining story line. I do not understand the purpose of my dreams,
   but intentions to document it have always been there, be it the series
   ‘Son of Sea’ or ‘Red Man’…. I like to photograph my dreams. To me,
   photography is not just a medium of communication. It is a medium
   through which we can create a world, a world that we all know can never
   exist”.
   Project 365 photographer Shiv Kiran Project 365 photographer Shiv Kiran

   Shiv is originally from Yellamanchali, Andhra Pradesh. The beauty of
   Ladakh has moved many, and a few ordinary people have been reborn as
   photographers there. Shiv Kiran’s journey is one such story. While he
   was pursuing his masters in Computers, he began with shooting on
   campus, at college fests and then worked with Rahul Lal and Rohit Lal
   as a concert photographer. But it was that one trip to Ladakh that
   changed everything for him. There was another turning point in his life
   when Shiv delved deeper into the subject, when he learnt the History of
   Photography, studied the masters, their lives and what photography was
   all about in reality. He looked at the world differently and started
   shooting what he truly believed in. After he assisted renowned
   photojournalist Prashanth Vishwanathan on assignments on wheat
   harvesting in Jalandar and another series called ‘Cancer Express’,
   (Bhatinda village) he started to enjoy documentary photography and
   began to work on interesting stories. He is fascinated by surrealism,
   and enjoys making pictures that does not necessarily have a meaning,
   but more a feeling. Shiv has exhibited his work at the International
   Photo Festival, Ahmedabad, 2011. He also did an exhibition with Arnav
   Rastogi in Kuzart Lane, HauzKhas Village, Delhi, in 2012. His concept
   of ‘Son of Sea’ – a series that he worked on, has been largely
   appreciated. He is also a part of Fseven Photographers, a collective of
   professional photographers. He is working on a project titled “Deeper
   in Transit” as part of Project 365, Tiruvannamalai.

   “Some dreams are very difficult to talk about, as something that
   happens does not relate to reality at all, simply triggered through our
   sub-conscious way of thinking. And some are triggered through our
   experiences in the real world or the conscious state. Deeper in transit
   is one such journey, where my dreams travel through the light and
   darkness, whatever that means…”, he adds.

   This church was one such journey for Shiv. It had started from his
   dream. Leo James, one of the Project 365 photographer who is
   documenting the presence of Christianity in Tiruvannamalai shared this
   image. This was once a place of worship now abandoned and used by drug
   addicts. Inside this holy place we can find alcohol bottles and pack of
   cards spread all over. To Shiv, this conveys a different meaning
   altogether. He said, “In this place (Tiruvannamalai) of lord Shiva, who
   says transformation is part of life and the story of this abandoned
   church is surely one such transformation”.

   Shiv’s quest is philosophical and attempts at creating visual anecdotes
   of his dream(s). “I do not have lucid dreams unfortunately and so I
   cannot say what next. But it progresses, sometimes the transitions make
   sense and sometimes it is complete non-sense. That is how dreams are
   supposed to be, I think. The inception of this series was with another
   visual, which was clicked later. I was in search of a water body near
   to hill. I had sleepless nights because it was there every-night and I
   had to find it. It was during Ganesh visarjan we found the water body.
   But only while I was going through the photographs I noticed I found
   the hill exactly similar to my dream.

   The hill represents God Shiva himself and the boat is the faith we are
   sailing upon. We all are in search of Moksha after all and most of us
   do not know which is the right boat to sail on….”

Inner and outer path, a 360degrees perambulation of the Hill

   “By seeing Chidambaram, by being born in Tiruvarur, by dying in Kasi,
   or by merely thinking of Arunachala, one will surely attain
   Liberation.” – Arunachala Mahatmyam

   Arunachala refers to the holy hill at Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. The
   hill is also known by the names Arunagiri, Annamalai Hill, Arunachalam,
   Arunai, Sonagiri and Sonachalam. Tiruvannamalai is revered as ‘Agni
   Sthala’ (Fire), one of the five elements described in shaivite
   philosophy. The Annamalaiyar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is located
   at the base of the hill. Every year in the Tamil month of Karthigai
   (October–November), the Karthigai Deepam (Light) is lit atop the hill.
   The circumambulation of Arunachala Hill is known as Giri Pradakshina in
   Sanskrit and Giri Valam in Tamil. Every full moon, several thousand
   pilgrims perambulate around the Hill.  The pilgrims usually walk bare
   feet, chanting hymns and mantras dedicated to the holy Hill.

   The 14km perambulation has two different paths. One is the commonly
   known ‘outer path’ and not so common ‘inner path’. The inner path is
   belongs to the Protected Area of the State Forest Department. The Life
   in outer path is versatile and alive with many pilgrims walking and
   chanting. The well made road and pavements are often crowded with
   different shops that serve the circumnavigating pilgrims. This path is
   vibrant with life and activities. The life in inner path is totally
   different. In reality, the inner path is an abode to the Sadhus of
   Tiruvannamalai. The perennial ponds, the lone trails, the animals,
   unique plants and serene silence adorn the protected inner path.

   Thiruthuraipoondi, Thiruvarur Ditrict, Tamil Nadu. He started exploring
   photography when he was very young. He has completed his MBA. He is
   currently based in Chennai.

120 years of ‘Christian presence and lifestyle’ in Tiruvannamalai

   Christianity in the state of Tamil Nadu, India is believed to be 2000
   years old. It possibly was introduced to Tamil Nadu by St. Thomas, the
   Apostle, one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ who landed in Malabar
   Coast (modern day Kerala) in AD 52. But today, these Saint Thomas
   Christians or Syrian Christians are found mainly in Kerala. Later the
   colonial age brought a large number of Portuguese, Dutch, British and
   Italian Christians to Tamil Nadu. According to 2011 census, the
   percentage of Christians in Tiruvannamalai District accounted to 2.95%
   of the total population.

   Leo James, Project 365 photographer will be documenting the presence of
   Christianity in Tiruvannamalai. Camera always fascinated Leo and he
   always had the eye of an artist, and immense talent too. Leo enjoyed
   drawing and painting from a very young age and his father always hoped
   that he would ultimately opt for a career as an architect. But long
   before he was done with high school, he knew what he wanted to be for
   the rest of his life – a photographer. He was first inspired by what he
   saw in magazines and began by reading up on the art, learning the
   basics and techniques with the help of books on photography. Leo
   started following local photographers and photojournalists in his
   hometown Kollam, making friends, and learning from them whatever he
   could. After topping his Bachelors in Mass Communication and Video
   Production from the Kerala University, which also taught photography
   extensively, he was ready to take on the world. From conceptual works
   to autobiographical details, Leo experimented with the various realms
   of picture taking. He shot for events at first to fund his personal
   projects, maintaining a balance between his commercial work and his own
   passion, to take pictures of what interested him most as a creative
   person. Leo did an internship with some of the best advertising
   photographers in Cochin at that time, and mastered the art of studio
   photography.

   While he was contemplating moving to Dubai, he met Abul Kalam Azad, a
   revered photographer who made a huge impact on him as a person and as
   an artist. Leo spent some valuable time with Abul, his most admired
   mentor, as he assisted him with his work and learnt more along the way.
   Leo currently works in Dubai, on various commercial projects and his
   portfolio includes industrial photography, products,
   architecture,events and even portraits. While he is an expert with his
   planned studio shots that he takes with his digital camera, he also
   experiments with the analogue medium, shooting with several different
   cameras and films. Most of Leo’s personal work is hugely
   autobiographical. It artistically reflects his journey from Kollam to
   Cochin and to Dubai and all his connections with different people and
   places, and the experiences he has had in between. Leo’s photos also
   portray a poignant sensitivity to his subjects, be it mundane objects
   in someone’s home, a cityscape, a fish market or his ode to an artist.
   His work also expresses his many moods, sometimes melancholic and
   sometimes nostalgic, among others.

   Arcot Lutheran Church formerly known as the Danish Missionary Church –
   a church with 150 years of mission in history, was founded in the year
   1863 at Melpattambakkam Village, Tamil Nadu, India, by the missionaries
   of the Danish Missionary Society and now spread over 5 districts of
   Tamilnadu, and one Pastorate in the State of Puducherry and one at
   Bengaluru, in the State of Karnataka India with the central
   administration office located at Cuddalore, Tamilnadu, India.

   In 1706 the first missionaries from Halle University, Bartholomew
   Ziegenbalg & Heinrich Plutcho were sent to India by the Danish King
   Frederick IV.  The German Missionary Ochs left the Leipzig Mission in
   1863 on the question of tolerating caste in the Church and started an
   Orphanage in Melpattambakkam in South Arcot District, Tamil Nadu.  In
   1864 he was accepted by the Danish Missionary Society as their
   Missionary. The Missionaries started school work. The preaching of the
   Gospel made them to establish congregations.  It was the Danish Mission
   Church till 1950 and the Danish Missionaries were the leaders at every
   stage.  In 1951 a new constitution was introduced and that paved the
   way for indigenous leadership and the church was named  “The Arcot
   Lutheran Church”. The Carmel Lutheran Church was established in the
   year 1890 and the Carmel Lutheran Church was established in the year
   1914 in Tiruvannamalai.

Shibu Arakkal in Tiruvannamalai

   Shibu Arakkal, Bangalore based photo artist is participating in Project
   365 – the collective public photo art project initiated by EtP to
   photo-document the fast changing ancient culture and contemporary
   lifestyle in Tiruvannamalai. Shibu Arakkal, son of eminent painter
   Yusuf Arakkal, was born in Bangalore and after completing his BA from
   St. Josephs’ Arts & Science College, Bangalore he got trained in
   digital media from Edit Institute, Bangalore. He was trained in
   photography under Sudhir Ramchandran and Rafique Sayed. Since 1999,
   Shibu’s works are widely exhibited in India and abroad. He has won
   several awards. The most recent is the Lorenzo il Magnifico gold prize
   in digital art at the prestigious Florence Biennale 2013.

   Shibu made his first visit to Tiruvannamalai on September 15, 2014. He
   spent almost three days, exploring the town, talking with the other
   Project 365 photographers and developing his concept as part of Project
   365. Something in him was profoundly touched by this visit to our
   ancient town. He says, “Many a souls have been lost in big cities and
   found in little towns. Tiruvannamalai is a town of gigantic profundity,
   spiritually and in the very essence of life itself, as anyone could
   see.

   When a relatively small patch of land is seeped in history, of kings
   and commoners, of gods and devotees, of saints and philosophers and of
   the land itself, the curious thing is how simple and yet relevant it
   can still remain. I speak of a relevance of this little town, in a very
   real sense of being and of being what you are and intensely proudly so.
   A reality untainted by connotations of a “virtual life” and of urban
   frustrations. It isn’t hard to see why the physical landscape of the
   town itself has such spiritual buoyancy, so much that immortal beings
   life Ramana Maharshi chose this patch of land to meditate in and to
   bring the outside world in to share that philosophy with. It is also
   curious that in-spite of being ruled by various dynastic monarchies,
   Tiruvannamalai has such distinct character, one of its own and of a
   very humble but rich legacy.

   Believers in destiny like I, seldom wonder why we are drawn to a place,

   often becomes the food for our own souls.”

   which the settlements are constructed interesting. In Project 365,

   தமது தனித்துவத்தின் வெளிப்பாடாக ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட உருவங்களை தேர்வு செய்து
   அவற்றை உலகிற்கு காட்டுவது மனித நாகரிகத்தின் வழக்கமாகும். இந்த

   சின்னத்தையோ, அல்லது ஒரு முக்கியமான நிகழ்ச்சியையே வெளிப்படுத்துவதாக
   அமைகின்றன. காலப்போக்கில், இந்த உருவகங்களே அந்தந்த ஊர்களின் மீது தமது
   ஆழ்ந்த தாக்கத்தை ஏற்படுத்தி, பின்னொரு நாளில் மக்கள் இந்த தனித்துவமான
   உருவத்தின் மூலமாகவே அந்த நகரத்தினை அடையாளம் கண்டுக்கொள்ள துவங்குகின்றன.
   இங்கனமே, இங்கு வாழ்ந்திருந்த ஒரு மகானின் புகைப்பட பதிவுகளே அருணாச்சல
   மலையின் அடிவாரத்தில் அமைந்துள்ள திருவண்ணாமலை எனும் புராதன நகரத்தின்
   முக்கியமான சின்னமாக திகழ்கின்றன.

   வெங்கட்ராமன் என்ற இயற்பெயருடன் 1879ம் ஆண்டு பிறந்த ஸ்ரீ. ரமணமகரிஷி,
   அருணாச்சலத்தால் ஈர்க்கப்பட்டார். 1^st Sep 1896 திருவண்ணாமலையினை
   வந்தடைந்தார். தமது 17ம் வயதில் அவருக்கு மிக உயர்ந்த அனுபவம் ஏற்பட்டது.
   அது என்னவெனில், முழு உணர்வுடன் தேகத்தில் இருக்கும் போதே மரணத்தை
   அனுபவித்தது ஆகும். இந்த மரண அனுபவம் அவருக்கு உடனடியான ஆன்மீக விழிப்பை
   தந்தது. இந்த புரட்சிகரமான மாற்றத்திற்கு பின் அவர் தமது இல்லத்தை விட்டு
   அண்ணாமலையெனும் தெய்வீக மலையால் ஈர்க்கப்பட்டு திருவண்ணாமலை நோக்கி
   வந்தார். அடுத்த 54 ஆண்டுகளுக்கு அவர் அண்ணாமலையை விட்டு நகரவே இல்லை.
   1955ம் ஆண்டு மகா நிர்வாணத்தை அடையும் வரை தம்மை நாடி வந்தோர்க்கெல்லாம்
   மிக எளிய அதே சமயம் நேரான பாதையில் ஆத்ம விசாரத்தின் மூலம் அத்வைத ஞானம்
   பெற வழி நடத்தி வந்தார்.

   மகரிஷி / ஸ்ரீ ரமண ஆஷ்ரம புகைப்படக்களஞ்சியம் / 1902

   ரமண மகரிஷியின் ஆக்கப்பூர்வமான உள்ளுணர்வு, பல்வேறு கலைகளை உள்ளடக்கியது.
   அவற்றுள் புகைப்படக்கலையும் ஒன்றாகும். முதன் முதலில் இந்தியாவில்
   புகைப்படக்கலை அறிமுகப்படுத்தப்பட்டபோது இந்திர ஜாலம் போன்று எப்படி ஒரு
   புகைப்பட கருவி புகைப்படங்களை உருவாக்குகின்றது என்னும் அதிசயம்
   எல்லாரிடத்தும் பரவியது. ஆனால், அதே சமயம், அது ஒருவனை புகைப்படம்
   எடுத்தால் அவனது ஆன்மாவைத்திருடிவிடும் என்ற அச்சத்தையும் உருவாக்கியது.
   ஞானிகள் மற்றும் ஆரத்திகள் மத்தியிலும் அநேகர் தம்மை புகைப்படம்
   எடுத்துக்கொள்ள முன் வரவில்லை.

   ரமண மகரிஷி ஒளியின் தாக்கத்தினையும், ரசாயன மாற்றதைப்பற்றியும் எங்கனம்
   ஒரு புகைப்பட தகட்டில் ரசாயன மாற்றம் ஏற்படுத்துகின்றது என்பதை பற்றியும்
   கொண்டிருந்த முன்னறிவு அவருக்கு புகைப்பட ஊடகத்தின் மீது ஏற்பட்ட
   ஆர்வத்திற்கு காரணமாக இருக்கலாம்.

   புகைப்படம் எனும் ஊடகத்தின் பல்வேறு சாத்தியக்கூறுகளையும் மற்றும் அதன்
   எழில் சார்ந்த திறமையையும் ரமண மகரிஷி நன்கு அறிந்திருந்தார்.

   இந்தியாவின் பல்வேறு இடங்களிலிருந்து வந்திருந்த புகைப்படக்கலைஞர்களுடன்
   அவர் சம்பாஷணைகளில் ஈடுபட்டு, எங்கனம் கடந்து விட்ட காலங்களின் நினைவுகளை
   உயிரோட்டமான பிம்பங்களாக உருவாக்குவது என்பதனை குறித்து வாதிப்பார். PRS
   Mani, Dr. TNK, GG Welling போன்ற இந்த புகைப்பட நிபுணர்கள் ரமண மகரிஷி
   மற்றும் ரமண ஆஷ்ரமம் பற்றிய பல்வேறு புகைப்படங்களை உருவாக்கினர். அகில
   உலகத்திலும் புகைப்பட கலைஞராக செங்கோல் நாட்டிய பிரெஞ்சு நாட்டு புகைப்பட
   கலைஞரான Henri Cartier-Bresson மற்றும் அமெரிக்க ஆவண புகைப்படக்கலைஞர்
   Eliot Elisofon போன்றோர் ரமண மகாரிஷியைப்பற்றி பல்வேறு பதிவுகளை
   உருவாக்கினர். இந்த புகைப்படங்கள் TIME போன்ற உலகளாவிய பத்திரிகைகளிலும்
   சஞ்சிகளிலும் பதிக்கப்பட்டன. இந்த பத்திரிககளில் மூலம் கிடைத்த உலகளாவிய
   விளம்பரம், திருவண்ணாமலை நகரம் சர்வதேச அளவில் அறியப்பட ஒரு முக்கிய
   காரணமாக அமைந்தது. இந்த புகைப்பட அச்சுகளையும், பதிவுகளையும் பத்திரமாக
   பாதுகாக்குமாறு ரமண மகரிஷி வலியுறுத்தி வந்தார். விலை மதிப்பில்லாத ரமண
   மகரிஷி மற்றும் ஆஷ்ரமம் சார்ந்த இந்தப்பதிவுகள் தற்பொழுது ரமண ஆஷ்ரமத்தில்
   வைக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன.

   புகைப்படங்கள் எடுப்பது மட்டுமல்ல, அனுராக் தன மனதில் தோன்றிய ஒரு முக்கிய
   கேள்விக்கும் பதில் தேடுகிறார். உருவமற்ற அத்வைத நிலையே முடிவான நிலை
   என்று உபதேசித்த ரமணரின் புகைப்படங்கள் எப்படி வழிப்பாட்டு
   பிம்பங்களாகவும் ஒரு நகரத்தின் ஆதார உருவமாகவும் மாறி விட்டன? மேலோட்டமாய்
   நோக்கும் பொது ஒரு தத்துவ முரண்பாடு போலவே தோன்றுகிறது. இந்தக் கேள்வியின்
   உள்ளார்ந்த பொருளினை உணரவும் இவர் ரமண மகரிஷி புகைப்பட கலைஞர்களுடன்
   நடத்திய உரையாடல்கள், போன்றவற்றினை ஆய்வு செய்வார்.

Life of children

   “Why I love to photograph children is because they are so different
   from adults. Like another species altogether… no complications, no
   pretenses. What you see is what you get. Till the ways of the world
   transform them slowly and steadily into people you can’t really
   decipher”. – Project 365 photographer Ami Gupta

   Ami Gupta, a photographer based in Chennai will be capturing the life
   of children in Tiruvannamalai. Ami will follow Children from
   diversified economic, religious and cultural backgrounds and
   photo-document their life and lifestyle.  She will be using the digital
   medium and will also experiment with the analogue cameras and
   techniques during the course of the year. This below interview presents
   Ami Gupta’s ongoing project in Tiruvannamalai as part of Project 365,
   the public photo art project initiated by EtP to document the fast
   changing South Indian culture and contemporary lifestyle.

   How and when did your journey as a photographer begin?

   Neither through my growing up years, nor through my advertising career
   as a copywriter, did I ever imagine that I would become a photographer.
   Someone stole the one and only camera I owned four years ago, and that,
   was actually the turning point in my life. I decided to buy a new
   camera, a DSLR and in no time it became my new raison d’être.
   Everything I saw through the lens seemed magical. Be it a shard of
   grass, a pattern of light rays, or ice cubes floating lazily in a glass
   of scotch, everything around became a subject of interest. That’s what
   photography did to me, made me see the world all over again …never the
   same.

   Project 365 photographer Ami Gupta

   Early experimenting was a self-learning process. I went on to learn the
   basics of photography with Mr. Raja Ponsing in Chennai and then began
   to consider photography as a career option. At first, it was all about
   ‘making’ pretty pictures, of interesting objects, glorious skies or
   good-looking places and people. No matter what the subject, my images
   have always been about what I connect with, in a relationship that is
   like a quiet underlying bond, using expressions that need no words.

   Along with my various random explorations, I started to photograph
   professionally, mostly interiors and products and children’s
   portfolios.

   Earlier this year, I was introduced to photojournalism and documentary
   photography. This was a very different genre of work, where beauty in
   pictures meant something else. What mattered was whether a photo had
   ‘soul’ or not… From street photography to a more focused approach to
   storytelling via pictures, I realized that I enjoyed this mode of
   photography even more. My first works in this realm, ‘Silent screams’
   and ‘BuriNazar’ were a part of a group exhibition on Besant Nagar Beach
   during Art Chennai 2014.

   What made you join Project 365? Tiruvannamalai, the temple town is not
   a particularly spectacular destination for a photographer. What has
   been your experience so far?

   I haven’t traveled much in India as a photographer. As I had mentioned,
   it’s actually just been 3 years since I took up photography seriously.
   As a kid yes, I had traveled much. My parents along with their friends
   would take us to visit one new state in India or hill station every
   year. As I grew older, there was always work that kept me so busy, and
   then children… and travel now was all about going to different
   countries. Thailand, Italy, Turkey, Spain… where should we go next? So
   many places, so little time. And the ‘so many places’ in India somehow,
   were never on top of the list.

   So when I first heard about Tiruvannamalai, to me it was just a vague
   town somewhere in Tamil Nadu. With a famous temple.Big Deal. Lots of
   people come to pray. Ok, so? There’s the Arunachala Hill. I’ve seen
   bigger, better.

   But then Project 365 happened.I decided to take it up just to do
   something different and experience something new. An unusual project in
   a place I had never been to. So here I am…

   This is the first time I am on a trip to focus on nothing else but
   ‘making pictures’. And after visiting this temple town just twice, I
   could tell that something in me has changed. Like I had been drawn to
   this place for reasons beyond my understanding, as though some mystic
   force had decided my fate. Maybe I’m being a bit melodramatic about it.
   But yes, I can feel some sort of a ‘peaceful energy’ if I may call it
   that, with every walk I take, every morning I wake up here, or each
   time I meet someone new. I don’t even know if I can explain it. I’m
   looking at life from another perspective now, however far removed from
   my actual lifestyle it may be.

   What is your project plan? How do plan to portray
   the diversified culture of Tiruvannamalai?

   I am right now in the process of spending time with children from
   different walks of life and different cultural backgrounds. I intend to
   document their every-day life, religious connections, the festivals
   they celebrate, where they study, what they play and much more.

   As part of Project 365, I will be photo-documenting the life of
   Virupaksham in Veda patasala, Sri Ramana Ashram.

   Vetriselvam was perched on his father’s bike as I walked by. This was
   during my walk to the town, a day after Project 365 Samarambam, that
   was held at Kalai Illam on 15th August 2014. Vetriselvam’s brothers and
   sisters were curious about my camera and me. They started to pose and I
   insisted that I want them to just play and continue doing what they do
   everyday. An ice-cream vendor passed by just then and Vetriselvam’s
   sister Gayathri looked up at her father with eyes full of longing. He
   shook his head, while I insisted that I treat them. For a child,
   happiness is as simple as that. A mango ice stick that has the power to
   make his or their day. Vetriselvam was in his element. Grinning away
   non-stop, while Gayathri recited poems and sang songs she’d learnt at
   school. I was welcome to stay and hang out with them, they offered me
   the peanuts that grew on their farm and just like that we connected. I
   will go back and give them these photos. Small moments of pleasure
   frozen forever. The image shows Vetriselvam after a satisfying ice
   cream.

   The above image is of Archana and Yuvraj. I vividly remember my visit
   to their home. The farms on either side of the road were glowing, with
   that healthy sunny green and yellow freshness you see after a bout of
   rain, and I was loving my walk. It’s strange how you come to meet
   people in life, and how they leave an impression on you. Like it was
   meant to be. That’s how I met 11-year old Archana. She was studying, or
   doing some homework sitting outside the door, as she looked up at me.
   Of course I wanted to take her picture, so we got chatting, about her
   school and her little brother and her parents who are farmers, (they
   grow and sell marigold flowers) She was learning English at school and
   her handwriting was impeccable. Indoors, a small room cluttered with
   daily objects surrounded her as she smiled for me. Her brother Yuvraj
   tried hard to pretend to be writing so that I would take photos of him
   too. As I looked around at their threadbare belongings, and at the
   hardship in her parents’ eyes, I ‘felt’ a sense of hope for them. They
   are giving their very best to their children- an education that is
   priceless, and the only reason for hope that their lives will change.

   Thank you Ami Gupta

Sufi mystics and Islam in the temple town

   Hazrath Syedini Bibi, a legendary woman Sufi in the temple town

   Early nineteenth century, from the Middle East, Syedini Bibi, a Sufi
   woman mystic came to Nagore Dargah (a dargah built over the tomb of the
   Sufi saint Hazrath Nagore Shahul Hamid / 1490–1579 CE). After visiting
   the Nagore Dargah, she traveled to Tiruvannamalai where she lived the
   rest of her life. During the eighties, the Nawab of the time built a
   Dargah in the Car Street, Tiruvannamalai in honor of Syedini Bibi.
   There is very little information about this Sufi fakir, however several
   mystical stories connected to her tomb are spread via word of mouth.

   PUBLIC archives

   There are several other Dargah’s and Sufi saints related to this
   ancient town. Sufism, a concept in Islam is defined by scholars as the
   inner, mystical dimension of Islam; others insist that it is a
   perennial philosophy of existence that pre-dates religion, the
   expression of which thrived within the Islamic religion. Some hold that
   the essence of Sufism has also been expressed via other religions and
   meta-religious phenomena, while others believe Sufism to be something
   totally unique within Islam. A practitioner of this tradition is
   generally known as a Sufi. They belong to different “orders” (turuq,
   meaning congregations formed around a master). The “orders” meet for
   spiritual sessions (majalis), in meeting places known as zawiyahs,
   khanqahs, or tekke.

   The history of Islamic rule in Tiruvannamalai

   The history of Tiruvannamalai revolves around the Annamalaiyar Temple.
   The recorded history of the town dates back to the ninth century, as
   seen from a Chola inscriptions in the temple. Tiruvannamalai has been
   ruled by the Pallava kings, the Chola Kings, the Hoysola kings, and the
   Vijayanagar Empire. It is during the 17th century, Tiruvannamalai came
   under the dominion of the Nawab of the Carnatic. As the Mughal empire
   came to an end, the Nawab lost control of the town, with confusion and
   chaos ensuing after 1753. Subsequently, there were periods of both
   Hindu and Muslim stewardship of the temple, with Muraru Raya, Krishna
   Raya, Mrithis Ali Khan, and Burkat Ullakhan besieging the temple in
   succession. As European incursions progressed, Tiruvannamalai was
   attacked by French Soupries, Sambrinet, and the English Captain Stephen
   Smith. While some were repelled, others were victorious. The French
   occupied the town in 1757 and it came under the control of the British
   in 1760. In 1790, Tiruvannamalai town was captured by Tippu Sultan, who
   ruled from 1750 till 1799. During the first half of the 19th century,
   the town came under British rule. Inspite of the active presence of
   Islamic rulers and dynasties, the percentage of Islamic people is
   confined to 1.02% of the total population (according to Censes 2011).
   There are number of Sufi Dargahs in this ancient town.

   EtP’s ongoing Project 365, a PUBLIC PHOTO ART project, is collectively
   photo documenting Tiruvannamalai using traditional and modern
   photographic techniques. As part of Project 365, M. K. Iqbal, a
   photographer hailing from Kerala proposes to document the Sufi
   tradition, its institutions, people and its relevance in
   Tiruvannamalai.

   M. K. Iqbal is a documentary photographer with considerable experience
   in videography as well. Iqbal runs Studio Moon in Vaduthala in
   Alappuzha District in Kerala. Iqbal dropped out of a pre-university
   course in commerce to join the Cameraman Institute in Ernakulam for a
   one-year diploma in photography and videography. He developed into a
   professional photographer under the guidance of photographer Suleiman
   in Kochi. He became a freelance soon afterwards, but left it for a
   brief while to pursue social activism. He joined Campaign Advertising
   in Bangalore and learned the art of industrial photography. Later he
   joined the Madhayamam Daily in Ernakulam in 1993 and worked there till
   1997. In 1997, he left for New Delhi where he had a successful stint as
   a freelancer, working for a string of magazines, both print and online,
   which range from Mean Time magazine to Tehelka. Iqbal’s passion for his
   own land and its people led him to implement several projects, the
   major ones being Project Mainstream in Mumbai in 1998 and “My Land and
   the People” sponsored by the Varthamanam Daily.

“சமகால தமிழர் வாழும் அறைகள்”

   ‘ஒரு நகரத்தின் பண்பாடு அங்கெ வாழும் மக்களால் நிர்ணயிக்கப்படுகிறது’
   என்று டில்லியைச் சார்ந்த ஆர்னவ் ராஸ்டோகி நம்புகிறார். ஒரு மனிதனுக்கு
   மிக இணக்கமான ஒன்றைப்பற்றி ஆராய்வதைத்தவிர அவனை விவரிக்கும் சீரிய வழி
   வேறென்ன இருக்க முடியும்? அவன் வாழும் இல்லம் அத்தகைய ஒரு பிம்பம் ஆகும்.
   ஒரு முழுமையான இல்லத்திலிருந்து அவர்கள் பெரும்பாலும் வாழும் இடமாகிய ஒரு
   அறையை மட்டும் நான் புகைப்படமாக்க  தேர்ந்தெடுக்கிறேன். இந்த ஒரு தனியறை
   மட்டுமே வெவ்வேறு விதமான மனிதருக்கு எங்கனம் வெவேறு விதமாக
   பொருள்படுகின்றது என்னும் கோணம் என்னை மிகவும் வசீகரிக்கிறது. ஒரு
   சிலருக்கு அவர் இல்லம் என்று குறிப்பிடும் வீடு, வெறும் தனியறையாக
   அமைகிறது; மற்றொருவருக்கோ அது ஒரு விஸ்தாரமான கூடுதல் இடம். வேறு
   சிலருக்கோ அவை அவர்தம் சிறப்பான பொருட்களை கண்காட்சியாக்க
   ஒதுக்கப்பட்டுள்ள அறையாகி விடுகின்றது. ஏனைய சிலருக்கு இவை அங்கே வாழும்
   குடும்பத்திற்கு தேவையான பொருட்களை வைக்கும் ஓர் இடமாக அமைகிறது. அது
   விஸ்தாரமாக இருக்கலாம். அல்லது, குறுகியதாக இருக்கலாம். சமயம் சார்ந்த
   பொருட்களையோ, சித்திரங்களையோ அல்லது பளிங்கிலான சிறு பொருட்களையோ வைக்கும்
   இடங்களாக இருக்கலாம். அது எப்படி இருந்தாலும் சரி, வாழும் அறையானது ஒரு
   இல்லத்தின் மிக முக்கியமான இடமாகும். ஒவ்வொருவரின் வாழும் அறையும், தனது
   தனிப்பட்ட கதையினை நமக்கு எடுத்துக்கூறுகிறது”. ‘இக்கால தமிழர்  வாழும்
   அறைகள்” என்று பெயரிடப்பட்டுள்ள ஆர்னவின் திட்டம், இங்கனம் மனித வாழ்வின்
   மலர்கின்ற வேறுபாடுகளை ஆவணப்படுத்துவதாக அமைகிறது.
   Project 365 team photographer Arnav Rastogi Project 365 team
   photographer Arnav Rastogi

   வாழும் அறைகளைப்  பற்றிய அவருடைய இந்தத் திட்டம் ‘Sunday guardian’
   பத்திரிகையில் வெளியிடப்பட்டுள்ளது. வாழ்கையின் வெவ்வேறு பரிணாமங்களை
   வெவ்வேறு மக்களுடன் அவர் தொடர்பு கொண்டு, அவர் இல்லங்களுக்கு சென்று
   அவர்தம் வாழ்வியல் முறையை மிகத்தெளிவான அதே சமயம் மிக நுண்மையான புகைப்பட
   வடிவில் அளிக்கிறார். இந்த புகைப்பட வடிவங்கள் ஒரு சாமான்யனுடன் அவர்
   கொண்டுள்ள தொடர்பின் வெவ்வேறு விதமான படைப்பளிப்புகள் ஆகும். இவை வெவ்வேறு
   குடும்பங்களும், மனிதர்களும் தமக்கு சௌகரியமான பரிமாணங்களில் இருக்கும்
   நிலைகளை பிரதிபலிக்கின்றன. நாம் நமக்காக நம்மைச்சுற்றி
   ஏற்படுத்திக்கொள்ளும் சூழ்நிலைகளே நாம்  யார் என்பதை நிர்ணயிக்கின்றன.

   ஆர்னவ் முதன்முதலில் தனது கல்லூரி நாட்களில் புகைப்படக்கருவியைக் கொண்டு
   சோதனைப்படங்கள் எடுத்தார். அதில் வெற்றிக்கண்ட இவர், புகைப்படக்கலையால்
   மிகவும் ஈர்க்கப்பட்டு, IT துறையிலிருந்து புகைப்படத்துறைக்கு   தன்னை
   மாற்றிக்கொண்டார். Sri. Aurobindo Center for Arts and Communication
   அமைப்பிலிருந்து தமது பட்டயத்தை பெற்ற பின், அவர் தம் உணர்ச்சி
   வெளிப்பாடுகளையும், விலங்கினங்களையும் தமது கேமராவில்  பதிவு
   செய்யத்துவங்கினார். அகமதாபாத் நகரில் 2011ம் ஆண்டு நிகழ்ந்த creative hut
   என்ற அமைப்பு நிகழ்த்திய சர்வதேச புகைப்பட விழாவில் அவரது புகைப்படங்கள்
   காட்சிக்கு வைக்கப்பட்டன. இவை தற்பொழுது F-seven என்று பெயரிடப்பட்ட
   புகைப்பட கூட்டமைப்பின் ஒரு பகுதியாக அமைந்துள்ளன.

   ஆர்னவின் நோக்கம் எல்லா இடத்திலும் பயணம் செய்து தனது வாழும் அறைகள் எனும்
   புகைப்பட ஆவணத்திட்டத்தை இந்த நாடு முழுவதும் கொண்டு செல்வதாகும். இதில்
   ஒரு முக்கியமான ஏணிப்படி திருவண்ணாமலையின் ‘தினம் ஒரு புகைப்படம்’ /
   Project 365 ஆகும். வேகமாய் மாறி வரும் தமிழ் கலாச்சாரத்தினை புகைப்பட
   ஆவணப்படுத்தும் பொதுமை சார்ந்த புகைப்படக்கலை திட்டமே Project 365.
   திருவண்ணாமலையில் நிறுவப்பட்டுள்ள இ.டி.பி நிறுவனம், பிரபல
   புகைப்படக்கலைஞர் அபுல் கலாம் ஆசாத் அவர்கள் தலைமையில் நடத்தும் இந்த
   திட்டத்தின் ‘சமாரம்பம்’ கடந்த 15ம் தேதி இனிதாக துவங்கியது. கடந்த ஒரு
   மாதத்திலேயே, ஆர்னவ், தளத்தில் உள்ள பல்வேறு நண்பர்கள் இல்லத்திற்கு
   விஜயம் செய்து, அவர்களது தனிப்பட்ட வாழும் இடங்களை நிலையான
   உயிர்த்துடிப்புள்ள புகைப்பட பிம்பங்களாக ஆக்கம் செய்துள்ளார். அவர்
   வழக்கமாக 35mm டிஜிட்டல் முறையில் படம் எடுத்தாலும், இவற்றை
   பதிப்பிக்கும்பொழுது அவர் சம்பிரதாயமான உப்பு மற்றும் ஆல்புமின் பதிவு
   செய்ய திட்டமிட்டுள்ளார்.

   தாழ்வாரமும் உள்ளன. அந்த வாழும் அறையே அவரது சயன (உறங்கும்) அறையாகவும்
   பயன்படுகிறது. அவரது வாழும் அறையில் ஒரு தனிப்பண்பு வெளிப்படுகின்றது.
   பல்வேறு புத்தகங்களும், சந்கீதக்கருவிகளும் பலவிதமான பொருட்களும் எங்கும்
   பரவிக் கிடக்கின்றன. ஆயினும் இதில் ஒரு குழப்பம் தெரியவில்லை. ஒரு
   தனிப்பட்ட ஒழுங்கே வெளிப்படுகின்றது. ஜெ. ஜெ. என்னைப்பார்த்துக் கூறினார்,
   “வெளியுலகத்தில் என்னைச்சுற்றி நிகழ்கின்ற பயண நிகழ்வுகளுக்கு நான் என்னை
   உட்படுத்திக்கொள்ள வேண்டியுள்ளது. இங்கேயோ, இங்குள்ள பொருட்களெல்லாம்

‘தினம் ஒரு புகைப்படம்’ / Project 365

   “பண்டைக் கலாச்சாரமும் சமகால வாழ்வுமுறையும்”

   தனித்துவமிக்க பொதுமை புகைப்பட ஆவணம்

   காலமாற்றத்தில் பண்டைத்தமிழ் கலாச்சாரம் அதி வேகமாய் மாறி மறைந்து வருவது
   நாம் அனைவரும் அறிந்ததே. மாற்றம் ஒன்றே நிலையான காரணத்தினால் இந்த காலச்
   சூழற்சியின் தாக்கத்தினை யாராலும் தடுக்க முடியாது. அதனை தடுக்க
   நினைப்பதும் அத்தனை சரியான அணுகுமுறை அல்ல. நவீன கால கண்டுபிடுப்புகளும்
   வளர்ச்சியும் அத்தியாவசியமானதே. அதுமட்டுமல்ல, மாறிவிட்ட சமுதாய பொருளாதார
   சூழ்நிலையில் பழங்கால பழக்க வழக்கங்களை பின்பற்றவும் இயலாது. ஆயினும்,
   வருங்கால சந்ததியினர் இந்த கலாசார மகிமையினை அறியாமலே போய் விடும் அபாயம்
   உள்ளது. சமகாலத்தில் இன்னும் தனித்து விளங்கும் பழங்கால தமிழ் வழக்கங்களான
   விருந்தோம்பல், கோலம் இடுதல், கிராம வாழ்க்கை முறை நமது தனித்துவ காளை
   மாடுகள், பாரம்பரியக் கட்டிடக்கலை, விவசாய அறிவு, வேட்டை ஆடும் திறன்,
   கொட்டைகளில் சினிமா, கல்யாணம், தாவணி, உணவு, கோலி சோடா, பம்பரம் விடுதல்,
   மிருகங்கள், அரிய மரம் செடிகள், வைத்திய முறைகள், பட்டாம் பூச்சிகள் என
   எல்லாம் மின்னல் வேகத்தில் எந்தவித ஆதாரமும் இல்லாமல் மாறி மறைகின்றது.
   பழங்காலத்தில் , ராஜாக்களும், மன்றங்களும், கலாசார ஆர்வலர்களும் தற்தமர்
   எல்லாம் கடந்த, உள்ள உற்ற “கட-உள்” என்ற பெயர் புனைந்த எல்லாம் ஆனா
   ஆண்டவனை கலாசார இயல், இசை, நாடகம் என்னும் நம் பொருள் படுத்தக்கூடும்
   கருவிகள் வாயிலாக மனிதநேய சமுதாய கலாச்சாரத்தை பெருமை படுத்தும் விதமாக
   சிலைகளும், சுவர் சித்திரங்களும், கோவில்களும், இசை, நாடகம், காவியங்களும்
   உருவாக்கினர். காலத்தினால் அழியாத இந்த அற்புத கலைகளை பொது மக்களாகிய
   நாமும் நமது வாழ்க்கையின் அங்கமாக்கி போற்றி ஆராதிக்கின்றோம்… அதன்
   அறிமுகமாகவும் விளங்கும் கடவுளையும் வணங்குகிறோம்! கலையாய் ரசிக்கின்றோம்!
   ஆய்வு செய்கிறோம்… அது மட்டுமல்ல நமது கலாசார சின்னமாக பேணி பாதுகாத்து
   வருகின்றோம்.

   தற்பொழுது உள்ள காலக்கட்டத்தில், சமகால தமிழ் கலாச்சாரத்தினை உலகிற்கு
   தெரியப்படுத்த இது போன்ற முயற்சிகள் அவசியமானதாகும். கன நேரத்தில் ஓடி
   மறையும் கானல் நீர் போன்ற காட்சியினை, இன்ப துன்ப தருணங்களை, ஆண்டாண்டு
   காலம் நிறம் மங்காத நிலவுபோல் நிலை நிறுத்தி வைக்கக்கூடிய திறம்பெற்ற
   நவகால கலைகளின் சிகரமான ‘புகைப்பட கலையின்’ மூலம் இந்த அழிந்து வரும்
   காலத்தினை நிலையான ஒரு வரலாற்று பொக்கிஷமாய் பதிவு செய்து ஆவணப்படுத்தும்
   நோக்கத்தில், ‘தினம் ஒரு புகைப்படம்’ – (Project 365) திட்டத்தினை
   திருவண்ணாமலை சார்ந்த EtP (Ekalokam Trust for Photography) செயல்படுத்த
   உள்ளது.

   அதன் முதலாம் கட்டமாக, தென்னிந்தியாவின் மிகவும் பழமையான தமிழ் நகரங்களில்
   ஒன்றான திருவண்ணாமலை நகரத்தினை புகைப்பட ஆவணம் செய்ய முடிவு
   செய்யப்பட்டுள்ளது. ‘பண்டை தமிழகம்’ என்றழைக்கப்படும் தமிழ்நாடு, கேரளா,
   ஆந்திரா, கர்நாடகா வரையறைக்குட்பட்ட வரலாற்று முக்கியம் வாய்ந்த இடங்களும்
   ஆவணப்படுத்தப்படும். அடுத்ததாக கொடுங்கல்லூர், காவேரி டெல்டா ஆவணபப்டுத்த
   திட்டம் உள்ளது.

   திருவண்ணாமலையில் மக்கள் கி.மு 1 ஆம் நூற்றண்டுக்கு முன்னரே நகரமைத்து
   வாழ்ந்து வருகின்றனர். இது “மதுரை” நகரினைவிட பழமையானது என்று வரலாற்று
   ஆவணங்கள் கூறுகின்றன. சுமார் 2500 ஆண்டுகளுக்கு முன் தொண்டைமான்
   இளந்திரையன் திருவண்ணாமலை நகரத்தை ஆண்டதை, சங்க இலக்கியமான பரிபாடல் மூலம்
   அறிய முடிகின்றது. கி.மு இரண்டாம் நூற்றாண்டிலேயே பதஞ்சலி முனிவராலும்,
   கி.பி. இரண்டாம் நூற்றாண்டு கால சங்க இலக்கியமான மணிமேகலைக்
   காப்பியத்திலும் இந்நகர் குறிப்பிடப்பட்டுள்ளது. கி.பி. நாலாம் நூற்றாண்டு
   முதல் ஒன்பதாம் நூற்றாண்டு வரை பல்லவர்களின் முக்கிய நகரமாக விளங்கிய
   திருவண்ணாமலை, கலை, மற்றும் தமிழ், சமஸ்கிருத மொழிகளின் கல்வியில் சிறந்து
   விளங்கியது. பல்லவர்கள் ஆட்சிக்கு முன் சென்னை, வேலூர், திருவண்ணாமலை,
   காஞ்சிபுரம் மற்றும் திருவள்ளூர் ஆகிய தற்கால மாவட்டங்களை உள்ளடக்கிய
   தொண்டை மண்டலத்தின் முக்கிய நகராக விளங்கியது.

   பண்டைக் கலாச்சாரமும் சமகால வாழ்வுமுறையும்

   சங்க காலம் தொட்டே கலைஞர்களின் விருப்ப பூமியாக விளங்கும் இந்நகரத்தில்,
   சமீப காலங்களிலும் பல்வேறு தலை சிறந்த கலைஞர்கள் பிறந்தும் வேறு
   நகரங்களில் மற்றும் நாடுகளில் இருந்து இங்கு வந்து வாழ்ந்தும், பற்பல
   கதைகள், கவிதைகள், ஓவியங்கள், திரைப்படங்கள், புகைப்படங்கள் என தமது கலை
   நயத்தையும் திருவண்ணாமலை பால் அவர்கள் கொண்டுள்ள அன்பையும்
   வெளிப்படித்தியுள்ளனர். அதனால்தான் என்னவோ திருவண்ணாமலை நம் நாட்டவர்
   மற்றும் அயல் தேசத்தவர் மத்தியிலும் ஓர் அங்கமாகிவிட்டது. கோவில், மலை,
   பெருமைமிக்க சித்தர்கள் மற்றும் ஞானிகளைத் தேடி பல்லாயிரக்கணக்கான
   பக்தர்களும் சுற்றுலா பயணிகளும் சாதுக்களும் வர தொடங்கினர். ஒவ்வொரு
   மாதமும் முழு நிலா அன்று கிரிவலம் செய்ய என லட்சக்கணக்கானோர் வந்து
   செல்கின்றனர். திறமிக்க இந்த விழாவினை கையாளும் அரசாங்கத்தின் சேவை
   பாராட்டுக்குரியதாகும். மருத்துவ கல்லூரி, பொறியியல் கல்லூரி, என
   கல்லூரிகளும் பாட சாலைகளும் மிகுந்து காணப்படும் இந்த நகரம், ஆடம்பர
   கார்கள், பல வண்ண பங்களாக்கள், போன்றவையால் அலங்கரிக்கப்படுகிறது. வெளி
   நாட்டவரின் வருகையும், கல்விமுறையும், கலாசார பகிர்தலும், மாற்றத்திற்கே
   உண்டான பல்வேறு கோணங்களை தன்னோடு உட்படுத்திக்கொண்டு, திருவண்ணாமலையினை
   வளர்ச்சியின் இலக்கினை நோக்கி வேகமாய் பயணித்துக் கொண்டிருக்கிறது.

   இதே கால சூழ்நிலையில் காளை மாடுகளும், மாட்டுச்சந்தைகளும், பழங்கால
   வீடுகளும், இயற்கையை வணங்கும் பாமர மக்களும் என பழமை மணம் வீசும் பசும்
   வயல்கள் நிரம்பிய கிராம சூழ்நிலை. பழமையும் புதுமையும் நேருக்கு நேர்
   நின்று உற்று நோக்கும் இந்த சூழ்நிலை எந்த நொடியில் வேண்டுமானாலும் நவீன
   வளர்ச்சியின் சிகரத்தினை நோக்கி வேகமாய் முன்னேறி சென்று விடும்.

   ‘தினம் ஒரு புகைப்படம்’

   இந்த கால மாற்ற தருணத்தை புகைப்படங்களாய் பதிவு செய்ய இருக்கும்
   இத்திட்டத்தில், பலவிதமான புகைப்படக் கருவிகள், கைப்பேசி, பழங்கால
   முறைகளான பிலிம் கேமரா மற்றும் pinhole புகைப்படக் கருவி போன்றவை
   உபயோகப்படுத்தப்படும்.. பல்வேறு விதமான புதிய மற்றும் பழைய அச்சு உத்திகள்
   கையாளப்படும். இது போன்ற உத்திகள் மூலம் மிகக்குறைந்த புகைப்படங்களே
   எடுக்கமுடியும். ஆயினும் சாதாரண ஆவணங்களை காட்டிலும் கலை நயமிக்கவையாக
   விளங்குகின்றன. பல்லாயிரக்கணக்கான டிஜிட்டல் பதிவுகளின் மத்தியில் இது
   போன்ற பாரம்பரிய கலையினை மேம்படுத்துவது நமது திட்டத்தின் சிறப்பு
   அம்சமாகும்.

   தொடரும்….

   இந்த பதிப்பிலுள்ள புகைப்படங்கள் எல்லாம் பதிப்புரிமை புகைபடக்கலைஞரின்
   உரிமை ஆகும். மீண்டும் பிரசரிப்பதற்கோ வேறு பதிப்புகளில்
   உபயோகப்படுத்துவதற்கோ முன் அனுமதி அவசியம். மேலும் தகவல் அறிய {0}4175

Contemporary Tamil Living Spaces

   “Each space tells its own story”

   Delhi-based Arnav Rastogi believes that a City’s character is
   determined by the people who live there. He says, “What better way to
   depict a person than to explore the things that are very personal to
   someone? One’s house is such a thing…. From the whole house, I choose
   to shoot a single room, their ‘living space’. I am always fascinated by
   the way this one room mean so differently for different people. For
   some it is just a single room that the family calls home, for others it
   is a lavish extra space; some living rooms are all about display,
   showcasing only a few special things, while others have within them
   everything that is essential to the family that lives there. Spacious
   or cramped, stuffed with religious artifacts, paintings or crystal
   knick-knacks, a living room is one of the most important spaces of any
   home. And each one tells its own little story.” Arnav’s project
   Contemporary Living Spaces” is an exploration of this human diversity.

   His project on living rooms has been published in the Sunday Guardian.
   He connects with people from different walks of life, visits their
   homes and captures their lifestyle in a very stark yet subtle manner.
   These vivid images are a diverse portrayal of his relationship with the
   common man and of various families and individuals in their comfort
   zones. These images also speak of the environment we create around
   ourselves that defines who we are.

   Arnav first experimented with the camera during his college days, and
   was so hooked that he went on to switch from IT to photography. After
   his diploma at the Sri Aurobindo Center for Arts and Communication he
   went on to capture candid and striking images of people and their
   emotions and also wildlife. He has exhibited at the International Photo
   Festival organized by Creative Hut held at Ahmedabad in 2011 and is
   currently a part of a photographer’s collective called Fseven
   Photographers[1].

   Arnav aspires to travel and take his project ‘Living spaces’ across the
   country and PROJECT 365 – Tiruvannamalai is a wonderful way forward.
   Within this one month, Arnav has entered the living rooms of many
   neighbors and friends of EtP and has created lingering images of their
   personal space. Though he is using the 35mm digital format for
   shooting, when it comes to printing, he will be experimenting with
   traditional salt and albumen prints.

   also lives with him. His father-in-law Sethu Raman (right) lives behind
   Dhanaveri’s house.

   Arnav fondly says, “Tiruvannamalai is a very spiritual and peaceful
   place, the people I have come across depict these qualities in their
   attitude and behaviour. I am very much impressed by the Tamil
   hospitality and often times I am offered home-made delicious Tamil
   food, which I greatly enjoy”.

   Arnav says, “I learn and enjoy the many interactions that happen during
   these shoots. Two weeks back I had gone to shoot the living space of J
   Jayaraman, PROJECT 365 photographer and a resident of Sri Ramana
   Ashram. His house had two rooms, a small court-yard and a living room
   which is also his sleeping space. His space had a specific character…
   books, music instruments and several other objects were lying all over…
   inspite of the seeming chaos, there was a peculiar order….   looking at
   me JJ said, “in the outside world I have to adjust to the traffic
   around me, here all the traffic adjusts according to me”. I smiled and
   knew inwardly that I am going to capture one of my most interesting
   image…
